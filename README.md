### This application makes it easy to be seen.
Diversity, equity, and inclusion are significant problems in this world. With 8 billion people, each being unique, there is bound to be conflict due to misunderstanding and miseducation of one another. Our application assists others in not feeling like outsiders but instead included as part of a community, no matter how small.

## Details
The application is based around informing eachother, so the main functionalities are an inclusive forum to share experiences, beliefs, principles, and 
identities as well as easy to digest statistics to inform one another.

## How to Use
You will be prompted with a menu to select between the forumn and statistics.

Make your choice and follow onscreen directions.
