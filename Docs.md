## Design
The design of the program is a menu system that allows you to access a forum or statistics.

The program was abstracted into classes to make for a cleaner and more simplistic user program.

## Data Structures
### Queue
The queue was used for the forum aspect of the application. It worked best to show chronological order of submissions into the forum.

### Linked List  
The linked list was used for statistics of the application. It allowed us to be able to sort, display, and manipulate the data in the best possible manner in comparison to other data structures.
